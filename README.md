# EZAC Flying Club Volunteer Shift Scheduler

This application is designed to help members of the EZAC flying club easily fill in their availabilities, preferences, and unavailabilities to volunteer for shifts. The traditional method of planning with paper and pencil has been replaced by a digital solution, making scheduling more efficient for both the planner and the club members.

## Features

- **Member Availability & Preferences**: Members can fill in their available times, preferred tasks, and times they are unavailable.
- **Workload Distribution**: An algorithm automatically sorts members based on their availability and preferences, ensuring that the workload is evenly distributed across all volunteers.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: A calendar-like interface allows members to view their shifts and update their availability in an intuitive way.
- **Task Assignment**: The system assigns tasks to members based on their preferences and availability to optimize shift planning.

## Problem Solved

Before this app, the EZAC flying club used a paper-and-pencil system for scheduling volunteer shifts, which was time-consuming and prone to errors. This digital solution makes it easier for members to input their information and for the planner to organize shifts quickly and accurately.

## How It Works

1. **Sign Up**: Members register for the app and enter their personal details.
2. **Set Availability**: Members fill in their available times and preferences for tasks.
3. **Task Assignment**: The appâ€™s algorithm processes the inputs and assigns members to shifts, aiming to balance the workload.
4. **View & Edit Shifts**: Members can view their scheduled shifts on the calendar UI and make adjustments as needed.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: Blazor
- **Backend**: Blazor Server and MS SQL
- **Algorithm**: Custom logic to distribute tasks based on member preferences and availability
